# ECEN1310_Final_Project
Final project for ECEN 1310 Spring '17

This project was a way to learn more about cryptography and an attempt to implement some of this learning into C code with rudimentary user input. Much of this was very intensive and non-trivial, but what I have compiled here represents some very simple (and insecure) cryptographic ciphers that have little real-world meaning nowadays (except for the stream cipher, although modern stream ciphers are much more complex and use a CSPRNG rather than a repeatable, dependent function PRNG, rand()).
